THE GREATEST CPU EVER BUILD  PERIOD 💅🏻
Hello , this is my attempt at building my very own 16 bit CPU from scratch , and by scratch I mean it starting at level of logic gates .
getting my knowledge from this great book:
 **The elements of computing systems: building a modern computer from first principles by  Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken**
and was inspired by Beneater. 
not sure where i am going with this one >.<
